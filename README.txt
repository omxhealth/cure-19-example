This is an example of using DrugBank's product concept API to search
for product concepts by drug, route, and strength.

The main code is the html in product_concepts.html and the javascript in
javascripts/product_concepts.js.

Note that the .js is not meant to access the DrugBank API directly and will
need to be adjusted for your particular web service.
